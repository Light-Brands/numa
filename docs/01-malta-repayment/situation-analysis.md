# Malta Loan Repayment — Situation Analysis

## Facts

- **Recipient**: Individual, Mexico City–born resident and taxpayer in Mexico
- **Amount**: $350,000 USD
- **Sender**: International company based in Malta
- **Nature of Payment**: Repayment of a loan (convertible note)
- **Original Loan Date**: Approximately 5–6 years ago (circa 2020–2021)
- **Original Structure**: Convertible note agreement with a company in Costa Rica
- **Source of Original Funds**:
  - Partially from an S.A. de C.V. (Mexican corporation) — now inactive
  - Partially from personal bank accounts in Mexico — now closed
- **Timeline**: Funds expected within 2 weeks

## Key Complexities

### 1. Entity Chain
The original loan went: **Mexican S.A. de C.V. + Personal Accounts → Costa Rica Company (convertible note) → [now being repaid by] Malta Company**

This three-jurisdiction chain requires documentation showing how the obligation transferred from Costa Rica to Malta.

### 2. Inactive Source Entities
- The S.A. de C.V. that funded part of the loan is no longer active
- The personal bank account used is no longer active
- This complicates proving the original outflow of funds

### 3. Convertible Note Nature
The original instrument was a convertible note — this is important because:
- If never converted, it remains debt (loan repayment = return of principal)
- If partially converted and then bought back, different tax treatment may apply
- The characterization of the payment (principal vs. interest vs. capital gain) determines tax treatment

### 4. Cross-Border Receipt
- Malta → Mexico international wire
- Mexican tax authorities (SAT) will see an international deposit
- Must be classifiable under a recognized category to avoid withholding or penalties

## Critical Questions to Resolve

1. **Was the note ever converted?** If it remained as debt, the repayment is return of principal (generally not taxable income). If converted and shares were sold, capital gains treatment applies.

2. **What documentation exists?** The original convertible note agreement, any amendments transferring the obligation from Costa Rica to Malta, correspondence confirming the debt.

3. **How was the original outflow documented?** Bank statements from the S.A. de C.V. and personal accounts showing the original transfer. Even though accounts are closed, bank records should be retrievable.

4. **What is the SAT's likely treatment?** An international deposit of $350K will trigger attention. The taxpayer must be prepared to demonstrate the source and nature of the payment.

5. **Is there any interest component?** If the note accrued interest, any interest received would be taxable income in Mexico. Only the principal return is non-taxable.
