# Malta Loan Repayment — Banking Strategy

> **Disclaimer**: This document is for planning purposes. Final banking decisions should be made with legal and tax counsel.

## Current Situation

- The original personal bank account used to make the loan is **no longer active**
- The S.A. de C.V. that partially funded the loan is **no longer active**
- A new or existing account must be designated to receive $350,000 from Malta

## Account Options

### Option 1: Personal Bank Account in Mexico (Recommended)
**Receive directly into a personal USD or multi-currency account in Mexico**

**Pros:**
- Simplest structure
- Direct receipt as the individual who made the original loan
- Consistent with the narrative: individual lent money, individual receives repayment
- Full visibility to SAT (compliance-positive)

**Cons:**
- Large international deposit will trigger bank compliance review
- Must have KYC documentation ready

**Recommended Banks:**
- BBVA México — strong international wire infrastructure
- Banorte — major Mexican bank with USD account capability
- Citibanamex — connected to Citi global network

**Key Requirements:**
- USD-denominated account or ability to receive USD wires
- Inform the bank in advance about the incoming international transfer
- Provide the bank with source documentation (loan agreement, Malta confirmation)

### Option 2: Existing Active Bank Account
**Use any current active account**

- If the taxpayer already has an active account at a major bank, this may be the fastest path
- Ensure the account can receive international USD wires
- Notify the bank's compliance department proactively

### Option 3: Brokerage or Investment Account
**Not recommended for initial receipt** — adds unnecessary complexity and may trigger additional reporting requirements. Funds can be moved to investment accounts after receipt and proper documentation.

## Pre-Receipt Checklist

- [ ] Identify or open the receiving account (USD-capable, international wire enabled)
- [ ] Notify the bank about the incoming $350K international wire from Malta
- [ ] Provide the bank with:
  - Copy of convertible note agreement
  - Confirmation letter from Malta company
  - Taxpayer RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)
  - Government-issued ID
- [ ] Obtain the full wire instructions (SWIFT/BIC, account number, beneficiary details)
- [ ] Send wire instructions to Malta company with sufficient lead time
- [ ] Confirm anti-money laundering (AML) documentation is complete

## Anti-Money Laundering Considerations

Mexican AML law (Ley Federal para la Prevención e Identificación de Operaciones con Recursos de Procedencia Ilícita) requires:

- **Transactions over $10,000 USD**: Enhanced due diligence by the bank
- **Transactions over certain thresholds**: Reporting to the Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF)
- The taxpayer should be prepared to explain the source, purpose, and documentation of the funds to the bank's compliance department

## Wire Transfer Details

Request the Malta company include the following in the wire reference:
- "Loan repayment — [reference to original note agreement]"
- Clear identification of sender and recipient
- Reference number from the original agreement if available

## Post-Receipt Actions

1. Obtain and retain the bank's transaction confirmation
2. Document the exchange rate if converted to MXN
3. File any required reports with SAT
4. Retain all documentation for a minimum of 5 years (SAT statute of limitations)
