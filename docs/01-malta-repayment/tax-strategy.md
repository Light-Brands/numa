# Malta Loan Repayment — Mexican Tax Strategy

> **Disclaimer**: This document is a research framework for discussion with qualified Mexican tax counsel. It does not constitute tax advice.

## Tax Classification of the Payment

The tax treatment depends entirely on how the $350,000 payment is classified:

### Scenario A: Pure Loan Repayment (Principal Only)
**If the convertible note was never converted and this is return of principal:**

- **General Rule**: Return of loan principal is **not taxable income** under Mexican ISR (Income Tax Law)
- **Key**: The taxpayer must prove the original loan existed and the funds were previously disbursed
- **Documentation Required**: Original note, proof of outflow, confirmation from Malta company
- **SAT Consideration**: The burden of proof is on the taxpayer to demonstrate this is a return of capital, not income

### Scenario B: Principal + Interest
**If the payment includes accrued interest:**

- **Interest Component**: Taxable as ordinary income under ISR
- **Rate**: Subject to the taxpayer's marginal rate (up to 35% for individuals)
- **Withholding**: Mexico-Malta tax treaty may affect withholding obligations
- **Action**: Separate the principal and interest components clearly in documentation

### Scenario C: Capital Gain (If Note Was Converted)
**If the note converted to equity, and this represents a share buyback or liquidation:**

- **Capital Gains Treatment**: Taxable, but calculated as proceeds minus cost basis
- **Cost Basis**: Original amount lent (adjusted for inflation via UDIS if applicable)
- **Rate**: Individual capital gains rates apply
- **Complexity**: Proving cost basis with inactive entities and closed accounts

## Recommended Classification Strategy

**Target: Scenario A — Pure loan repayment (return of principal)**

This is the most tax-efficient classification *if it accurately reflects reality*. Integrity requires that the classification match the actual facts.

### Steps to Support This Classification:

1. **Confirm the note was never converted** — obtain written confirmation from Malta company
2. **Document the full chain**: Personal/S.A. de C.V. → Costa Rica company → Malta company
3. **Obtain historical bank records** from the closed accounts showing the original transfers
4. **Get a formal acknowledgment letter** from Malta company stating: "This payment of $350,000 represents the repayment of principal on a loan originally made by [name] on [date]"
5. **Prepare an informative tax filing** (Declaración Informativa) disclosing the international receipt and its nature

## Mexico-Malta Tax Treaty Considerations

- Mexico and Malta **do have a tax treaty** (entered into force 2014)
- Article 11 (Interest): If there is an interest component, the treaty may limit withholding to 10%
- Article 13 (Capital Gains): May affect treatment if the note was converted
- **Key Benefit**: The treaty prevents double taxation — important if Malta applies any outbound tax

## SAT (Tax Authority) Compliance

### What SAT Will See
- An international wire of $350,000 from Malta
- This exceeds reporting thresholds — it **will be flagged**

### Proactive Compliance Steps
1. **File Form 76** (Declaración Informativa de operaciones relevantes) if required for the transaction size
2. **Include in annual declaration** (Declaración Anual) with proper classification
3. **Maintain complete documentation file** ready for any SAT inquiry
4. **Consider a preventive consultation** (Consulta) with SAT to pre-clear the treatment — this provides legal certainty

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| SAT reclassifies as income | Strong documentation of original loan |
| Cannot prove original outflow | Retrieve historical bank records NOW |
| Costa Rica → Malta transfer undocumented | Obtain assignment/novation agreement |
| Interest component is implied | Get explicit confirmation it's principal only |
| S.A. de C.V. records unavailable | Check Registro Público de Comercio for corporate filings |

## Recommended Professional Team

- **Mexican tax attorney** (abogado fiscalista) — primary advisor
- **Mexican CPA** (Contador Público) — filing and compliance
- **Maltese legal counsel** — to issue confirmation letters from Malta side
- **Notario Público** — if any notarization of documents is required
