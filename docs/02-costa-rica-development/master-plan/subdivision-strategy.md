# Master Plan — Subdivision Strategy

## Overview

Transform 111 hectares of raw land into a master-planned community through subdivision, infrastructure development, and phased residential construction.

## Subdivision Plan

### Plot Structure
| Element | Specification |
|---------|--------------|
| Total Area | 111 hectares |
| Number of Plots | 20 |
| Plot Size | 5 hectares each |
| Allocated to Plots | 100 hectares |
| Common Areas / Infrastructure | ~11 hectares |

### Common Areas Allocation (~11 hectares)
- Internal road network
- Utility corridors
- Green spaces / parks
- Community amenities
- Stormwater management
- Buffer zones

## Revenue Model

### Land Sales
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Gross Land Sales Revenue | ~$39,000,000 |
| Average Price per Plot | ~$1,950,000 |
| Price per Hectare (plot basis) | ~$390,000 |

### Value Creation
- Raw land cost: ~$49,500/hectare
- Subdivided plot value: ~$390,000/hectare (per plot)
- **Value multiplier: ~7.9x** through entitlement, infrastructure, and master planning

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: First 10 Hectares (2 Plots)
- Corresponds to the guaranteed security land
- **40 residential homes** planned
- Gross sales projection: ~$24,000,000
- Average home price: ~$600,000
- This phase proves the concept and generates cash flow for subsequent phases

### Phase 2–10: Remaining 90 Hectares (18 Plots)
- Can be sold as entitled plots to third-party developers
- Or developed in-house in subsequent phases
- Each plot's sub-development potential increases with master plan maturity

## Required Approvals and Work

### Permitting
- [ ] Municipal land use permit
- [ ] Environmental impact assessment (SETENA)
- [ ] Water availability letter (AyA or ASADA)
- [ ] Electrical availability (ICE/CNFL)
- [ ] Road access approval
- [ ] Condominium regime registration

### Engineering
- [ ] Topographic survey
- [ ] Geotechnical study
- [ ] Hydrological study
- [ ] Civil engineering (roads, drainage, grading)
- [ ] Utility engineering (water, sewer, electrical)

### Architecture & Planning
- [ ] Master site plan
- [ ] Architectural guidelines and standards
- [ ] Density analysis
- [ ] Common area design
- [ ] Landscape architecture

### Legal
- [ ] Condominium regime (Régimen de Condominio)
- [ ] Internal governance regulations (Reglamento Interno)
- [ ] Homeowners association structure
- [ ] Development guidelines and covenants

## Condominium Regime

Under Costa Rican law (Ley Reguladora de la Propiedad en Condominio, No. 7933):

- The condominium regime allows subdivision with shared infrastructure
- Each plot (finca filial) gets its own title while sharing common elements
- The regime defines:
  - Individual ownership areas
  - Common areas and shared infrastructure
  - Governance structure (assembly of owners)
  - Maintenance fee obligations
  - Architectural and use restrictions
  - Administrative structure

## Density and Design Standards

These need to be defined in the master plan and will govern:
- Maximum building coverage per plot
- Maximum floor area ratio
- Building height restrictions
- Setback requirements
- Architectural style guidelines
- Environmental buffers
- Landscaping requirements
