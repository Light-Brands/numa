# Legal Structure — Entity Design

> **Disclaimer**: This is a research framework. Entity formation and structuring must be reviewed by qualified legal counsel in Costa Rica and relevant investor jurisdictions.

## Structuring Objectives

1. Receive cross-border capital from Europe, US, Mexico, and other jurisdictions
2. Protect investors with appropriate security and governance
3. Structure land contribution as equity efficiently
4. Segregate land ownership, development risk, and construction risk
5. Optimize tax treatment under Costa Rican and international law
6. Maintain lean, scalable, and efficient structure

## Recommended Entity Structure

### Option A: Single Costa Rican S.A. (Simple)

```
                    NUMA S.A.
                  (Costa Rica)
                 /      |      \
        Seed         Landowner    Operations
      Investors      (Land Eq.)   & Development
       ($1M)          ($5M)
```

**Pros**: Simple, low cost, single governance structure
**Cons**: No risk segregation, all assets and liabilities in one entity

### Option B: Holding + Operating Structure (Recommended)

```
              NUMA Holdings S.A.
                (Costa Rica)
               /             \
      NUMA Tierras S.A.     NUMA Desarrollo S.A.
      (Land Holding)        (Development/Construction)
      - Holds title to      - Master planning
        111 hectares         - Construction
      - Landowner equity     - Sales
        sits here            - Investor operations
```

**Pros**:
- Segregates land asset from development/construction risk
- Creditors of the development entity cannot reach the land directly
- Land can be pledged as security for investors
- Clean structure for phased subdivision (transfer plots from Tierras to Desarrollo as needed)

**Cons**: Two entities = more admin cost, more accounting

### Option C: Full Segregation (Complex)

```
              NUMA Holdings S.A.
                (Costa Rica)
              /       |        \
     NUMA Tierras  NUMA Dev   NUMA Ventas
     (Land)        (Build)     (Sales)
```

**Pros**: Maximum risk segregation
**Cons**: Over-engineered for Phase 1; can evolve to this later

## Recommendation: Option B

Start with the **Holding + Operating** structure. It provides meaningful risk segregation without over-engineering. Can expand to Option C when the project scales.

## Equity Structure

### Within NUMA Holdings S.A.

| Shareholder | Contribution | Shares | Notes |
|------------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Community Investor Group (10 people) | $500,000 cash | TBD% | Via investment agreement |
| Second Investor Group | $500,000 cash | TBD% | Via investment agreement |
| Landowner | $5,000,000 (land) | TBD% | Via land contribution agreement |
| Founders/Management | Sweat equity | TBD% | If applicable |

### Key Equity Questions to Resolve

1. **Valuation of cash vs. land**: Is $1M cash equivalent to $1M land? Cash may warrant a premium (cash carries more flexibility and risk)
2. **Anti-dilution**: Do seed investors have protection against future dilution?
3. **Distribution waterfall**: How are profits distributed? Pro rata? Preferred returns for cash investors?
4. **Governance**: Voting rights proportional to ownership? Board composition?
5. **Exit mechanisms**: How can investors exit? Right of first refusal? Drag-along/tag-along?

## Cross-Border Investor Considerations

### US Investors
- **FIRPTA** implications on disposition of Costa Rican real property (generally not applicable since property is not in the US, but check)
- **PFIC rules** if the Costa Rican entity is considered a Passive Foreign Investment Company
- **FATCA** compliance — the Costa Rican entity may need to report US person accounts
- **Form 8865** (if US persons own >10% of a foreign partnership) or **Form 5471** (if corporation)
- **Accredited investor** requirements if offering is structured as a securities offering

### European Investors
- **CRS (Common Reporting Standard)** — Costa Rica participates in automatic exchange of information
- Local tax obligations in the investor's country of residence
- Withholding tax on distributions from Costa Rica

### Mexican Investors
- Mexican residents taxed on worldwide income
- Distributions from Costa Rica must be declared
- Mexico-Costa Rica tax treaty considerations
- SAT reporting requirements for foreign investments

## Costa Rican Corporate Law

### Sociedad Anónima (S.A.)
- Most common vehicle for real estate holding
- Minimum 2 shareholders (can use nominees)
- Board of directors required (minimum 3 members)
- Annual corporate compliance required (Registro Nacional)
- Corporate tax rate: 30% on profits
- Withholding on dividends to non-residents: 15%

### Property Transfer
- Transfer tax: 1.5%
- Registration fees: ~0.5%
- Share transfers of the S.A. can be more efficient than property transfers

### Land Contribution as Equity
- The landowner contributes the property to the S.A. in exchange for shares
- This is a non-cash capital contribution (aporte en especie)
- Requires an independent appraisal
- Transfer tax applies on the land contribution
- Must be documented in the articles of incorporation or a subsequent shareholders' agreement

## Tax Optimization Considerations

1. **Land contribution timing**: Contributing the land at formation may be more tax-efficient than a later transfer
2. **Profit repatriation**: Plan the distribution mechanism (dividends, management fees, loan repayments) to minimize withholding
3. **Transfer pricing**: If multiple entities, intercompany transactions must be at arm's length
4. **Capital gains on plot sales**: Taxable in Costa Rica; structure can affect effective rate
5. **VAT**: Real estate sales may be subject to VAT (13%) depending on the seller's status
