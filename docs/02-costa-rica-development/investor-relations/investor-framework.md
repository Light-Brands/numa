# Investor Relations — Framework

## Investor Groups

### Group 1: Community Investors
- **Structure**: 10 individual investors × $50,000 each
- **Total Commitment**: $500,000
- **Equity**: 50% of seed equity allocation
- **Character**: Likely friends, family, or community network
- **Key Concern**: Protection of principal, clear exit path

### Group 2: Second Investor Group
- **Total Commitment**: $500,000
- **Equity**: 50% of seed equity allocation
- **Structure**: TBD (could be a single entity, a fund, or a smaller group)
- **Key Concern**: Returns, governance rights

### Landowner
- **Contribution**: $5,000,000 (land at value)
- **Equity**: Participation in the project entity
- **Key Concern**: Value realization above raw land price, maintaining connection to the land

## Investor Protection Mechanisms

### 1. Asset-Backed Security
- Land itself serves as underlying collateral
- 10-hectare guarantee structure for the down payment
- Title held in a dedicated land-holding entity

### 2. Governance Rights
- Board representation for each investor group
- Supermajority requirements for major decisions:
  - Sale of substantially all assets
  - New debt above a threshold
  - Related-party transactions
  - Changes to the business plan
- Regular reporting obligations (quarterly financials, annual audit)

### 3. Information Rights
- Quarterly financial statements
- Annual independent audit
- Access to project documentation
- Advance notice of material events

### 4. Economic Protections
- **Preferred return**: Consider a preferred return to cash investors before profit split (e.g., 8-10% annual preferred return)
- **Distribution waterfall**:
  1. Return of capital to cash investors
  2. Preferred return to cash investors
  3. Pro rata distribution to all equity holders
- **Anti-dilution**: Pre-emptive rights on new share issuances

### 5. Exit Mechanisms
- Right of first refusal (ROFR) on share transfers
- Tag-along rights (minority can join a majority sale)
- Drag-along rights (majority can force sale in a full exit)
- Buy-sell provisions for dispute resolution
- Defined exit horizon or liquidity events

## Cross-Border Compliance Matrix

| Jurisdiction | Key Requirements |
|-------------|-----------------|

## Securities Law Considerations

### Is This a Securities Offering?

If investors are contributing capital with the expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others, this likely constitutes a **securities offering** under:
- **US law** (Howey test) — for US-based investors
- **Costa Rican law** — SUGEVAL (securities regulator) requirements
- **EU law** — for European investors, MiFID and Prospectus Regulation

### Likely Exemptions
- **US**: Reg D 506(b) or 506(c) (accredited investors, no general solicitation or with verification)
- **US**: Reg S (for non-US investors)
- **Costa Rica**: Private placement exemptions (limited number of investors)
- **EU**: Small offering exemptions, qualified investor exemptions

### Action Required
- [ ] Determine if US investors are involved → if yes, Reg D compliance
- [ ] Engage securities counsel in relevant jurisdictions
- [ ] Prepare appropriate offering documents
- [ ] Verify accredited investor status (US) or equivalent (other jurisdictions)
- [ ] Implement AML/KYC procedures for all investors

## Incentive Alignment

The structure should align incentives:

| Party | Incentive | Alignment Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Seed Investors | Capital protection + returns | Preferred return, asset backing, governance |
| Landowner | Value above raw land price | Equity participation in upside |
| Management/Founders | Project success | Sweat equity, milestone-based vesting |
| Community Investors | Stable returns + trust | Transparency, regular reporting, conservative projections |
