# Land Acquisition — Structure & Terms

## Property Details

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Location | Santa Teresa, Costa Rica |
| Total Area | 111 hectares |
| Purchase Price | ~$5,500,000 USD |

## Acquisition Structure

### Cash Component
- **Down Payment**: $550,000 (10% of purchase price)
- **Source**: Seed capital from investor groups
- **Timing**: At closing

### Equity Conversion Component
- **Amount**: $5,000,000 (90% of purchase price)
- **Mechanism**: Converted to equity participation for the landowner within the project entity
- **Effect**: Landowner becomes an equity partner in the development, rather than receiving cash

### Security / Guarantee
- **Trigger**: If the project does not proceed after down payment
- **Protection**: 10 hectares of the property are transferred to the investor group
- **Valuation Implied**: $550,000 / 10 hectares = $55,000 per hectare (vs. ~$49,500/ha for the full property)
- **Purpose**: Protects the seed investors' capital with a tangible, appreciating asset

## Key Structuring Questions

### 1. How is "project does not proceed" defined?
- What milestones or conditions trigger the security transfer?
- Is there a sunset date?
- Who makes the determination?

### 2. How is the landowner's equity structured?
- What percentage of the project entity does $5M represent?
- Does it dilute with future capital raises?
- What rights does the landowner have (voting, distributions, exit)?
- Is the equity preferred, common, or a different class?

### 3. What is the title situation?
- Is the land in the Maritime Zone (Zona Marítimo Terrestre)?
- If within 200m of high tide, special concession rules apply under Costa Rican law
- Is the land titled (finca) or concession-based?
- Are there any liens, easements, or restrictions?

### 4. Environmental and Zoning
- Environmental impact assessment (EIA) requirements
- Zoning classification and density allowances
- Water availability and rights
- Protected areas or buffer zones

## Costa Rican Legal Framework

### Foreign Ownership
- Foreigners **can** own property in Costa Rica in fee simple
- **Exception**: Maritime Zone (200m from high tide) — foreigners cannot hold concessions in the first 50m (public zone); the next 150m (restricted zone) requires concession and residency
- Santa Teresa is a coastal area — **Maritime Zone analysis is critical**

### Corporate Ownership
- Most foreign-owned real estate in Costa Rica is held through a **Sociedad Anónima (S.A.)** or **Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (S.R.L.)**
- Corporate ownership simplifies future transfers (share sale vs. property transfer)
- Transfer tax on property is 1.5%; share transfers may be more efficient

### Property Transfer Tax
- Transfer tax: 1.5% of the registered or fiscal value (whichever is higher)
- Registration fees: ~0.5%
- Legal fees: typically 1–1.25% of the transaction value
